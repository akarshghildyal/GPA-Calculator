## üß† What is GPA Calculator

GPA Calculator is a simple tool that instantly reads your grades in `evarsity.srmist.edu.in`, calculates your GPA, and displays it right below the table so you don‚Äôt have to leave the page or do any extra math.  
> **Note:** Results are now published directly on student portal, hence this does not work.

## üå± Why I Built This
There was real inconvenience every time results were released on `evarsity.srmist.edu.in`. The grades for each course were in plain sight, but my total GPA was nowhere to be found. I had to open another GPA calculator, copy each grade along with its course credit one by one, and only then would I finally see my score. All that hassle, when all I wanted was to instantly know how I performed,without adding another layer of effort just after getting my results.

While learning JavaScript, I realized I could solve this exact pain for myself. I built a mini-extension that automatically grabbed my grades, did the calculations in the background, and showed my GPA right below the table. No more manual entry.
